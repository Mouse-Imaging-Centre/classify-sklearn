# classify-sklearn
MINC wrapper for python's scikit-learn for tissue/lesion/etc classification.

classify-sklearn has functions for both supervised and unsupervised classification. Mean to take on the role of what good old classify in the MINC-world used to have, but with modern machine learning algorithms taken from the wonderful scikit-learn project.

Current state is fully functional with many algorithms as exposed, but work yet to be done on exposing more options controlling each of these algorithms.
